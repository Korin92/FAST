# NAME_OF_PROJECT FRONTEND

This is the {name_of_project} website develop in next js.

## SET UP

It is required to install pnpm. To do this, we install it with the following command:

```bash
wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh
```

Upon completion, it will ask us to "source" our terminal configuration file.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This assumes that your .bashrc file is located in your home directory (~). Adjust the path accordingly if it's in a different location.

To launch the frontend we must first install the node_modules with the `pnpm install` command.

Once installed we launch the web platform with `pnpm dev`.
